        <p>Course project for UCSD's CSE291H Healthcare Robotics. Team of 2. Spring 2017.<p>

    	<h2>Works</h2>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Designed a golve intended to help people with hand/wrist injueries to carry out hand therapies in a home setting</li>
    			<li>Integrated gyroscope, EMG sensor and touch sensor with an Arduino Uno</li>
    			<li>Implemented user interface and communication between Arduino and laptop using Processing 3</li>
    		</ul>

    	<h2>Sensors</h2>
    	<p>Used some sensors that I have never used before. So I think it might be interesting to introduce them here.</p>

    	<p>The first one is called EMG(electromyogram) sensor. This sensor can sense the electrical activity of the muscle. We used it in the project to sense if the user is gripping.</p>

    	Touch sensor. I knew there are force sensitive resistors, but I didn't expect them to be this thin. And turns out it is pretty good at sensing force applied on it.

    	<h2>Results</h2>

    	Here is our demo video.
