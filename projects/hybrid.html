                <h1>Hybrid Powered UAV</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Innovation and Practice Program, funded by SJTU. Team of 5. From 2014 to 2015.</p>

        <h2>Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and built a hybrid powered UAV and expolred its possible applications</li>
                <li>Tried to realize beyond-line-of-sight fly</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Attemps</h2>
        As shown below, we were able to get a realtime video stream from the RC plane by using a video transmitter. This gave us the potential to do some first person view flies. However, since the performance of the plane is not very stable, we didn't really try that.
