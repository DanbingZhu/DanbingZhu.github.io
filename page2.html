        <h2>Shooting Ranges</h2>
        <p>Guns are illegal in China. When I was young, I loved to play with airsoft guns. Now, even the airsofts are illegal. Actually, as long as the kinetic energy of the projectile is larger than 1.8J/cm^2, the launcher will be classified as some sort of weapon instead of a toy.</p>

        <h3>The Gun Range San Diego</h3>
        <p>TGRSD is an indoor range. It is not large but still a very clean and comfortable place to shoot.</p>

        <h3>Los Angeles Gun Club</h3>
        <p>I went to this range in December 2016. They have a much larger collection of guns compared to TGRSD.</p>
